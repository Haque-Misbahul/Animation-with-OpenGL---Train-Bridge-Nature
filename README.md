# Animation-with-OpenGL---Train-Bridge-Nature
# 🖼️ Overview
This project is a 2D animated scene built using C++ and OpenGL, simulating a vibrant environment featuring:

A flowing river

Colorful sky gradients

Lush green hills

A bridge with architectural detail

A train with bogies and wheels

A flying airplane

A sailing ship

All elements are animated or statically rendered to bring a lively scenic view to life.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
C++

OpenGL (GLUT) — for graphics rendering and display

Windows API (Sleep function) — for animation timing

# 🧱 Features
Smooth animation of a moving train and airplane

Multi-layered environment design (sky, water, land, structures)

Dynamic elements like smoke from the train

Usage of polygons and circles to construct objects

Reusable components like the circle() function for wheels
